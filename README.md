# QuickStart Guide: Sterling Order Management on Azure

This repository provides deployument guidance and best practices for running IBM Sterling Order management (OMS) on Azure Redhat OpenShift (ARO) in the Azure public cloud. This guide was written and tested with Azure RedHat OpenShift 4.9.9 and OMS Version X.XX

> ðŸš§ **NOTE**: The scripts contained within this repo were written with the intention of testing various configurations and integrations on Azure. They allow you to quickly deploy the required infrastructure on Azure so that you migrate an existing OMS to Azure, or start fresh with new development.

> ðŸš§ **WARNING** this guide is currently under active development. If you would like to contribute or use this right now, please reach out so we can support you.
